# CSCI E-3 Unit 3B

Rob: the HTML does not validate because of issues with Larry's original HTML. I hope that the
     errors and warnings that appear as a result of this do not affect my grade since it came
     with these errors to start with.

Below is a list of the four problems I've done for credit and the two for extra credit.

## Problems counting for credit:
* Problem #1
* Problem #2
